# Networking

Small app with networking usages.
App does requests to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com site with free API endpoints. I have 4 tasks:
- Get all users (GET)
- Get post by ID with all related comments (GET)
- Get all posts with related comments and users (GET)
- Update a user (UPDATE)
App uses:
- URLSession/Alamofire for requests,
- Promises for work with asynchronous code.
